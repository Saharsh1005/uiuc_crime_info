# UIUC Crime Web Application [link](https://cs411-puredata.uc.r.appspot.com/)

### Problem Statement & Motivation

To enhance safety and convenience in Urbana-Champaign, there is a need for an improved way to share information about security incidents around the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The current Daily Crime Log and Daily Crime Log Map provide valuable data but lack user-friendly features. Our proposed solution is a comprehensive crime reporting web application designed to transform the accessibility and presentation of critical information, empowering the community to make informed decisions for personal safety.

### User Problems being solved

- **Improve data accessibility:** The current tabular format of the Daily Crime Log is ineffective. Our application provides a more user-responsive framework for better data accessibility, ensuring informed decision-making for personal safety.

- **Community Safety:** By enhancing access to and understanding of campus crime data, the application contributes to the safety and security of the entire Urbana-Champaign community.

### Basic interactions our app supports in service of our goal

- **Data Retrieval:** Users can access crime data, including incident reports, locations, and relevant details through the application.

- **Reporting Tips:**  A distinctive feature involves enabling users to report crime tips directly to the police through a submission form, providing an easy and efficient online platform for reporting tips that can be investigated further.


- **Historical Data Visualization:** The app displays historical crime data through charts and visualizations, empowering users with insights into trends and patterns over time.

- **Interactive Mapping:** An interactive map interface allows users to visualize crime incidents for location-based decision-making.

- **User Authentication:** Users and Admins can signup and login to make the most of all our functionalities.
  
### How our app is different

* Unique Focus: Our app distinguishes itself by specifically catering to the Urbana-Champaign community, offering more relevant and targeted information compared to general platforms like Crimemapping.com or Citizens.
* Data Accuracy and Reliability: Unlike apps allowing user-generated content, such as Citizens, we exclusively rely on official sources for data, enhancing the app's overall reliability.
* Holistic Information Delivery: In contrast to UIUC-specific websites like the Daily Crime Log or Police Blotter, our app provides more comprehensive insights through data visualization rather than presenting raw data alone.
* Reporting Tips: A distinctive feature involves enabling users to report crime tips directly to the police through a submission form, providing an easy and efficient online platform for reporting tips that can be investigated further.
