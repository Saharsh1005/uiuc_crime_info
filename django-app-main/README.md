# UIUC Crime Web Application

### Problem Statement & Motivation

To enhance safety and convenience in Urbana-Champaign, there is a need for an improved way to share information about security incidents around the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The current Daily Crime Log and Daily Crime Log Map provide valuable data but lack user-friendly features. Our proposed solution is a comprehensive crime reporting web application designed to transform the accessibility and presentation of critical information, empowering the community to make informed decisions for personal safety.

### User Problems being solved

- **Improve data accessibility:** The current tabular format of the Daily Crime Log is ineffective. Our application provides a more user-responsive framework for better data accessibility, ensuring informed decision-making for personal safety.

- **User Personalization:** The application allows users to tailor their experience by highlighting specific crime spots on an interactive map, filtering incidents by activity, time, or vicinity. Leveraging the Language Model (LLM) API, it generates daily briefs and advisories based on user-defined keywords.

- **Community Safety:** By enhancing access to and understanding of campus crime data, the application contributes to the safety and security of the entire Urbana-Champaign community.

### Basic interactions our app supports in service of our goal

- **Data Retrieval:** Users can access crime data, including incident reports, locations, and relevant details through the application.

- **User-Specific Filtering:** Users can filter crime data based on preferences, such as crime types, timeframes, and geographical locations.

- **Historical Data Visualization:** The app displays historical crime data through charts and visualizations, empowering users with insights into trends and patterns over time.

- **Interactive Mapping:** An interactive map interface allows users to visualize crime incidents for location-based decision-making.

- **Daily Briefing & Advice:** The application generates a daily briefing and advice for users, incorporating user-provided keywords for relevant safety information.

### How our app is different

Our crime reporting web application stands out by focusing solely on the Urbana-Champaign community. Unlike platforms like Crimemapping.com and Citizens, our application prioritizes data accuracy by sourcing information exclusively from official and trusted sources. In comparison to UIUC-specific websites, our platform provides a holistic approach, offering insights and facilitating informed decision-making through data visualization. A unique feature is the daily briefing and safety advice, leveraging historical data and language models for personalized, timely, and data-driven recommendations.
